        <p>Hey guys!! Its so cool writing to you all on my first blog post ever, on my cool new personal blog page! Anyways, I was doing some studying on my favorite tracks recently, and it made me think, "What are the fastest posted times on these tracks?” It took me some time to find out the information that I wanted, but ultimately I found the fastest laps around Laguna Seca, Silverstone, and Monza. All of these times were set in cars with little to no limitations, and both the Monza time and the Silverstone time were set in literal F1 cars. (holy hell) I compiled all of the times and when they were set into a table on my post, and hopefully it is readable to you. For now, at least for me, I have some more lap times to find and try to beat, maybe some day I will add a new post to this blog comparing my fastest times around these tracks to the times I posted today! Who knows? I still have way too much racing left to do while Im alive so I guess I will leave you guys on the internet and I will get back to driving my cars fast!</p>

        <h3>Important Track Times Data Table</h3>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Track</th>
              <th>Best Lap Time</th>
              <th>Date Achieved</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Silverstone</td>
              <td>1:27.345</td>
              <td>2023-05-12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        <h2>Second Blog Post</h2>

        <p>Hey again guys!!! Little bit of a different post than last week but who cares! This is my favorite car of all time! It’s the Bugatti Veyron 16.4, made by Bugatti in the mid 2000s and it instantly became my favorite car when I saw it for the first time. I think I saw it in a book about fast cars in elementary school for the first time, and since then it has always stuck with me. It has a 16 cylinder engine, (most normal cars have 3-6) and makes over a thousand horsepower!!! That’s literally insane. It can go from 0-60 in 2.6 seconds and it looks like a weird egg that was made to go as fast as possible. It sounds insane, like a raspier V8 engine but just better in every way. I have seen a couple in real life and  every time I do it always makes me stop and stare. It was also in a ton of the videogames that I played when I was growing up, most notably to me was Need For Speed Shift, where there was a mission in the game that had you driving one of these down one of the hardest tracks in the world (it was a simulation type game) and I could never do it because of how fast the car was. This will always be my favorite.</p>
