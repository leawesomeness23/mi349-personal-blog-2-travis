      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <center><img src="MElol.jfif" alt="A picture of me"></center>

      <p>Hello! I'm Drew Travis, a passionate coder, gamer, and game developer who loves to share projects.</p>

      <p>Outside of coding, I am passionate about racing, sports, and anything to do with cars. I plan to apply my coding and design expertise to some kind of racing application later in the future.</p>

      <p>My main interests came from my childhood, growing up for some reason I always found myself playing or watching videogames, and this shaped me in ways that are almost inexplicable. I played a lot of racing and car related games as a kid, as well as sports and other themed games, but the most common type was racing. This led me to become obsessed with cars as well as motorsport, pretty much defining who I am today. </p>
      <h3>Some of My Interests</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Racing and Motorsports</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Sports Analytics</li>
        <li>Technology and Gadgets</li>
        <li>Coding and Game Development</li>
      </ul>
    </main>
